# English_Dictionary_Search
Group Project for CS310 Advanced Algorithms Course. Programmed by Hagop Ketchedjian &amp; Wilson Phan

This code is an English Dictionary Searcher. 

# The user can provide special search queries to find words which fit the query (Ex. "A-" will return "Apple"; "Accordian"; "Acceptance"; etc., along with their definitions):

The output which the program returns is always sorted in alphabetical order.

The runtime of this code is O(n*log(n)).
